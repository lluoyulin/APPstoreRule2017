# 2017最新苹果APPstore审核协议
1. Safety
When people install an app from the App Store, they want to feel confident that it’s safe to do so—that the app doesn’t contain upsetting or offensive content, won’t damage their device, and isn’t likely to cause physical harm from its use. We’ve outlined the major pitfalls below, but if you’re looking to shock and offend people, the App Store isn’t the right place for your app.
1.1 Objectionable Content
Apps should not include content that is offensive, insensitive, upsetting, intended to disgust, or in exceptionally poor taste. Examples of such content include:
1.1.1 Defamatory or mean-spirited content, including references or commentary about religion, race, sexual orientation, gender, or other targeted groups, particularly if the app is likely to place a targeted individual or group in harm’s way. Professional political satirists and humorists are generally exempt from this requirement.1.1.2 Realistic portrayals of people or animals being killed, maimed, tortured, or abused, or content that encourages violence. “Enemies” within the context of a game cannot solely target a specific race, culture, real government, corporation, or any other real entity.1.1.3 Depictions that encourage illegal or reckless use of weapons and dangerous objects, or facilitate the purchase of firearms.1.1.4 Overtly sexual or pornographic material, defined by Webster's Dictionary as "explicit descriptions or displays of sexual organs or activities intended to stimulate erotic rather than aesthetic or emotional feelings."1.1.5 Inflammatory religious commentary or inaccurate or misleading quotations of religious texts.1.1.6 False information and features, including inaccurate device data or trick/joke functionality, such as fake location trackers. Stating that the app is “for entertainment purposes” won’t overcome this guideline. Apps that enable anonymous or prank phone calls or SMS/MMS messaging will be rejected.
1.2 User Generated Content
Apps with user-generated content present particular challenges, ranging from intellectual property infringement to anonymous bullying. To prevent abuse, apps with user-generated content or social networking services must include:
A method for filtering objectionable material from being posted to the appA mechanism to report offensive content and timely responses to concernsThe ability to block abusive users from the servicePublished contact information so users can easily reach you
Apps with user-generated content or services that end up being used primarily for pornographic content, objectification of real people (e.g. “hot-or-not” voting), making physical threats, or bullying do not belong on the App Store and may be removed without notice. If your app includes user-generated content from a web-based service, it may display incidental mature “NSFW” content, provided that the content is hidden by default and only displayed when the user turns it on via your website.
1.3 Kids Category
The Kids Category is a great way for people to easily find apps that are appropriate for children. If you want to participate in the Kids Category, you should focus on creating a great experience specifically for younger users. These apps must not include links out of the app, purchasing opportunities, or other distractions to kids unless reserved for a designated area behind a parental gate. Keep in mind that once customers expect your app to follow the Kids Category requirements, it will need to continue to meet these guidelines in subsequent updates, even if you decide to deselect the category. Learn more about parental gates.
Apps in the Kids Category may not include behavioral advertising (e.g. the advertiser may not serve ads based on the user’s activity), and any contextual ads must be appropriate for young audiences. You should also pay particular attention to privacy laws around the world relating to the collection of data from children online. Be sure to review the Privacy section of these guidelines for more information.
1.4 Physical Harm
If your app behaves in a way that risks physical harm, we may reject it. For example:
1.4.1 Medical apps that could provide inaccurate data or information, or that could be used for diagnosing or treating patients may be reviewed with greater scrutiny. If your medical app has received regulatory clearance, please submit a link to that documentation with your app.1.4.2 Drug dosage calculators must come from the drug manufacturer, a hospital, university, health insurance company, or other approved entity, or receive approval by the FDA or one of its international counterparts. Given the potential harm to patients, we need to be sure that the app will be supported and updated over the long term.1.4.3 Apps should not encourage illegal or excessive consumption of drugs or alcohol; or encourage minors to consume drugs, alcohol, or tobacco; and facilitating the sale of marijuana isn’t allowed.1.4.4 Apps may only display DUI checkpoints that are published by law enforcement agencies, and should never encourage drunk driving or other reckless behavior such as excessive speed.1.4.5 Apps should not urge customers to use their devices in a way that contradicts safety documentation for Apple hardware, risking damage to the device or physical harm to people. For example, apps should not encourage placing the device under a mattress or pillow while charging. Review device documentation.
1.5 Developer Information
People need to know how to reach you with questions and support issues. Make sure your Support URL includes an easy way to reach you. Failure to include accurate and up-to-date contact information not only frustrates customers, but may violate the law in some countries. Also ensure that Wallet passes include valid contact information from the issuer and are signed with a dedicated certificate assigned to the brand or trademark owner of the pass.

与用户生成内容的应用程序提出了特别的挑战，从知识产权侵权到匿名欺负。为了防止滥用，应用程序与用户生成的内容或社交网络服务必须包括：

孩子类是一个很好的方式让人们很容易地找到适合儿童的应用程序。如果你想参加孩子类，你应该专注于创造一个伟大的经验，专门为年轻用户。这些应用程序不包括链接的应用程序，购买机会，或其他分心的孩子，除非预留在父母的门后指定的区域。记住，一旦客户期望你的应用要遵循孩子范畴的要求，它将需要继续满足后续更新这些指南，即使你决定取消类。了解更多关于父母的大门。
在儿童类别中的应用程序可能不包括行为广告（例如，广告客户可能不基于用户的活动服务的广告），和任何上下文广告必须适合年轻观众。您还应该特别注意世界各地的隐私法有关收集儿童在线数据。请务必审阅这些信息的隐私部分以获取更多信息。

1.4.1医疗应用程序可能提供不准确的数据或信息，或可用于诊断或治疗的患者可进行更严格的审查。如果您的医疗应用程序已收到监管间隙，请提交链接到该文档与您的应用程序。
1.4.2药物剂量计算器必须来自药品生产企业、医院、大学、医疗保险公司、或其他经批准的实体，或获得批准由FDA或其国际同行。鉴于潜在的伤害患者，我们需要确保该应用程序将得到支持和更新的长期。
